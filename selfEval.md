# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
My time management is good. I make sure to complete assignments as soon as
possible during or after I finish work. The only support I can think of is
getting a schedule or calendar of any important events coming up that I'm not aware of (example: test, evals, interviews, class schedule) that way I can outline it in my planner. I currently have Mod 1 generally laid out in my calendar but I'm unsure of the class topics occurring on those days. I recommend having a planner and writing down your homework on its due date with a check box. That way you know when it's due and it motivates you to check it off when you're done.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
You have a pet dog. Your dog knows of a lot of tricks. When you say a trick name like "jump!" the dog will jump. The action of the trick is known as a function. When you call/say the trick name, you are calling this function.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Arguments go inside of a called function's parenthesis because it's data you're going to use later. Parameters are how you import the data within your function.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
Can functions call other functions?
